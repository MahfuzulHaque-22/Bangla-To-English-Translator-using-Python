# Bangla-To-English-Translator-using-Python




In the above code, we first import the Translator class from the Googletrans library. We then initialize a translator object with the URL of the Google Translate service. We define a Bangla sentence to translate and use the detect() method of the translator object to detect the language of the input text. If the detected language is not English, we use the translate() method to translate the text to English. Finally, we print the original and translated texts. Note that the translation quality may vary depending on the complexity of the input text and the performance of the translation model.
